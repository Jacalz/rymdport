Rymdport (formerly wormhole-gui) is a cross-platform application that lets you easily and safely share files, folders, and text between devices.
The data is sent securely with end-to-end encryption using the same protocol as [magic-wormhole](https://github.com/magic-wormhole/magic-wormhole). This means that Rymdport can talk not only to itself, but also to other wormhole clients.

The transfers are implemented using [wormhole-william](https://github.com/psanford/wormhole-william), a native [Go](https://go.dev/) implementation of magic-wormhole. As a result, Rymdport compiles into a native binary with no runtime dependencies while also outperforming the reference implementation of magic-wormhole.

## Requirements

Rymdport compiles into a statically linked binary with no explicit runtime dependencies.
Compiling requires a [Go](https://go.dev) compiler (version 1.17 or later are supported) and the [prerequisites for Fyne](https://developer.fyne.io/started/).

## Building

Systems with the compile-time requirements satisfied can build the project using `go build` in the project root:
```bash
go build
```

The project is available in the [Fyne Apps Listing](https://apps.fyne.io/apps/rymdport.html) and can be installed either using the `fyne get` command or using the [Fyne Apps Installer](https://apps.fyne.io/apps/io.fyne.apps.html).

Installation can also be performed using GNU Make (installing this way is currently only supported on Linux and BSD):
```bash
make
sudo make install
```

## Name

The word "rymdport" (pronounced `[rym:dporâ€¿t:]`) comes from the Swedish language and means "space gate".
As a wormhole is a kind of gateway through space, it became the new name after "wormhole-gui".
